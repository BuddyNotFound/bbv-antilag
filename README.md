> **BBV X WORLD | Pops & Anti-Lag**


Simple script that makes your car throw flames an pop when on specified RPM, you can select specific cars on which to work or enable all, it comes with support for ESX/QB and ST (Standalone) notifications. the pop sounds I took from [Yorick20022](https://github.com/Yorick20022).

Flames are made to work on all vehicles and all exhausts and its more optimized than other anti-lag resources, All Flames and pops are synced between vehicles/players.

The colored flames shown in the video are not part of the resources but I've still added Config option to change them if you use my [Changeable Colors](https://forum.cfx.re/t/paid-nitro-system-changeable-colors-much-more-qb-esx-standalone/5156013/1) , or any other.

You can also use my **FREE** [Red Nitro Flames](https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-red-nitro-flames/5156471/2)
