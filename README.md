> **BBV X WORLD | Advanced Anti-Lag**

This is updated version of the simple anti-lag system I posted, some people from my community requested I make an paid **Advanced System**, where it saves on the plates and you can install it per vehicles, but decided to release it for **FREE**.

Resource works on **All frameworks**, **All Vehicles** and **All Exhausts**. The resource has build in support for QB/ESX but it can be used as standalone with commands and the build in permission system, it also has images and **Discord Logs**.

You will need **[Interact Button]( https://forum.cfx.re/t/free-interact-button/5152798)** for the resource to work or you can change it to something you like.
